I believe out of all the sections in Chapter 1 of “The Pragmatic Programmer,” the section “Take Responsibility” spoke to me the most. I related to this section on multiple levels and it gave me an almost nostalgic feel to my childhood. The reason I got so nostalgic is because a lot of the phrases used in this section are things that my parents used to preach to me and say when I was young, actually there still say them to me!
	“Don’t make some lame excuse” and “take responsibility for what you’ve done,” are just a few of the things my parents used to tell me. Especially since I used to get in trouble at home and at school. Even though I had been told not to blame others, I always would if there was a way, but my parents always knew I was lying, so it rarely worked. 
	In the section they say “when you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it.” I resonated with this line a lot due to the fact that now that I’m older and there’s a lot more at risk when I make a mistake or do something stupid, I always attempt to take responsibility for it, unless of course what happened was out of my control. 
	For example, my father is a police officer, so when I started driving he told me to mention his name if I had ever gotten pulled over. Of course, I ended up getting pulled over pretty quickly since I was young boy driving a sports car.  But even though my father told me he wouldn’t let me drive if I had gotten a ticket, I had accepted that it was my fault and didn’t mention my father name. Fortunately I didn’t get a ticket, but my father always asks me why I never mentioned his name, which is kind of ironic for him by the one telling me to take responsibility for things all my life.

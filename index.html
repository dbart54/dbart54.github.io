Project teams are a huge integral of daily careers nowadays, due to projects being too large for just a single person to do. Back in the days not many people were needed to complete projects, for example; it only took one person to invent the light bulb and only two to invent the airplane. In todays day and age, teams are necessary for the scale of projects. However, cooperation between teams can actually hurt the efficiency of production. The people chosen for the team have to be compatible and able to help but not get in each others way. Putting a group of individuals together is similar to an equation, except there is no correct answer, there is only a better or worse answer. In the section “Project Teams” in “A Pragmatic Programmer,” issues with project teams are figured to be a orthogonality issue. This orthogonality issue happens “when teams are organized with lots of overlap, members are confused about responsibilities” (Chapter 2). 
	In my personal experience, I believe that when choosing members of a team, each individual needs to be able to specialize in and cover a specific part of the project, but also have a bit of experience in the other areas needed. This way, no one will be arguing over which path to take for different parts, but will also be able to assist each other if needed. Also, the team should not be too large due to the fact that it can cause communication errors if there are too many. Sometimes, if there are enough you can have someone heading each section with sub teams following their instruction. This will cause the project to have a large team, but in return should control the communication and increase project speed.
	So, in conclusion, picking members for a team is extremely difficult and may require a lot of trial and error before officially beginning. There are many ways to go about picking the best possible option, but sometimes there are specific circumstances that prevent that certain team you want, so you’ll have to work around it.
